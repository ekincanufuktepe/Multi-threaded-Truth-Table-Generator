# Multi-threaded-Truth-Table-Generator

This project is created for generating very large truth tables. Therefore, it uses the BigInteger library.

Since that I work a lot with Bayesian Networks and experiment on large software, my truth tables become too large and the computation time takes too long. So I have written this small project if anyone else is in the same situation just like me.
